<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>I am a recent graduate from Claremont McKenna College where I obtained a dual degree in Physics and Mathematics. I am very excited by the advancements in the use of computers in the modeling of complex physical systems and I am very interested in the creation of software that enables computational exploration of the physical world. I am dedicated to the development of open source software.</p>
