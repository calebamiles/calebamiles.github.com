<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>I am a recent graduate from Claremont McKenna College where I obtained a dual degree in 
Physics and Mathematics. I am very excited by the advancements in the use of computers
in the modeling of complex physical systems and I am very interested in the creation of 
software that enables computational exploration of the physical world. I am dedicated to 
the development of open source software</p>

<h2>Industry Experience</h2>

<h3>Inktank, Los Angeles CA</h3>

<h4>Development Intern - May 2012 to present</h4>

<p>Performed experimental algorithm analysis of CRUSH, part of the open source 
Ceph project. Developed software in response to feature requests and bug reports. 
Gained familiarity with agile practices and distributed software development.</p>

<h3>TradeLink LLC, Chicago IL</h3>

<h4>Consultant Programmer - Winter 2010</h4>

<p>Used Cython to improve the performance of a large Python application.</p>

<h3>NRG Systems Inc, Hinesburg VT</h3>

<h4>Engineering Intern - Summers of 2007,2008, and 2010</h4>

<p>Involved in a wide variety of projects in the research and development, and 
technical support departments. </p>

<p>I developed Python and BASH scripts for data analysis and visualization of 
large datasets. I also served as engineering lead on several field service 
trips. I designed a relational database and a supporting data entry work flow
for an extensive data analysis project. I designed and fabricated a variety of 
test and calibration fixtures. I also performed a variety of data analysis tasks
using NumPy/SciPy, and Microsoft Excel. </p>

<h2>Teaching Experience</h2>

<h3>Claremont McKenna College, Claremont CA</h3>

<h4>Biology Teaching Assistant - Semesters of Fall 2010 to Spring 2012</h4>

<p>Teaching assistant for Biology 133: Introduction to Mathematical Physiology, 
and Biology: 155: Selected Topics in Computational Neuroscience instructed by
Professor John Milton. </p>

<p>I assisted Dr. Milton during weekly programming labs by fielding student 
questions and troubleshooting minor programming errors. I provided additional
assistance outside of lab to students who required it. I provided short 
demonstrations on the software implementation of course concepts as well as 
special programming tools and techniques. I assisted in the organization of a two 
day workshop on scientific programming given by John Hunter and Fernando Perez.</p>

<h4>Physics Grader - Semesters of Fall 2010 to Fall 2011</h4>

<p>Grader for Physics 100: Computational Science and Engineering, and 
Physics 108: Programming for Scientists and Engineers.</p>

<p>Graded weekly MATLAB homework assignments.</p>

<h4>Physics Teaching Assistant - Semesters of Spring 2010 to Fall 2010</h4>

<p>Teaching assistant for Physics 79: Energy and the Environment instructed by 
Professor Sam Tanenbaum.</p>

<p>I held weekly problem solving sessions for students who needed additional 
assistance with homework assignments. I also led review sessions for midterm 
examinations along with grading student assignments. </p>

<h2>Research Experience</h2>

<h3>University of Hawaii, Honolulu HI</h3>

<h4>Undergraduate Intern - Summer of 2011</h4>

<p>Participated in a NSF funded Research Experience for Undergraduates in 
Computational Fluid Dynamics under principal investigator Dr. Marcelo
Kobayashi. </p>

<p>I modified standard solvers provided by the open source OpenFOAM distribution 
in order to solve the Navier-Stokes equations in a body fixed frame to support 
the laboratories work in the study of the flapping flight of insects. I performed 
verification and validation studies of my modified solvers.   </p>

<h3>University of New Mexico, Albuquerque NM</h3>

<h4>Undergraduate Researcher - Summer of 2010</h4>

<p>Participated in a NSF funded Research Experience for Undergraduates 
in computational quantum chemistry under principal investigator Dr. Hua Guo.</p>

<p>I developed a new work flow for the laboratory which employed the open source
Atomic Simulation Environment to drive a commercial code to perform studies of 
the activation energy of several proposed pathways of Methanol Steam Reformation
on metal catalysts.  </p>

<h3>University of Washington, Seattle WA</h3>

<h4>Undergraduate Intern - Summer 2009</h4>

<p>Involved in optical design in the lab of Dr. Jay and Maureen Neitz at 
the University of Washington Medical Center. </p>

<p>My research objective was to assemble an adaptive optics system so that visual 
stimuli could be projected to a research participant absent of corneal aberrations.
I was responsible for specifying optical components for order along with the 
creation of engineering drawings for the fabrication of custom structural components.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>Bachelor of Arts in Physics and Mathematics from Claremont McKenna College. Sequence (minor)
in Scientific Modeling. Graduated in 2012. </p>
