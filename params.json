I am very excited by the advancements in the use of computers\r\nin the modeling of complex physical systems and I am very interested in the creation of \r\nsoftware that enables computational exploration of the physical world. I am dedicated to \r\nthe development of open source software\r\n\r\n## Industry Experience\r\n\r\n### Inktank, Los Angeles CA\r\n\r\n#### Development Intern - May 2012 to present\r\n\r\nPerformed experimental algorithm analysis of CRUSH, part of the open source \r\nCeph project. Developed software in response to feature requests and bug reports. \r\nGained familiarity with agile practices and distributed software development.\r\n\r\n### TradeLink LLC, Chicago IL\r\n\r\n#### Consultant Programmer - Winter 2010\r\n\r\nUsed Cython to improve the performance of a large Python application.\r\n\r\n### NRG Systems Inc, Hinesburg VT\r\n\r\n#### Engineering Intern - Summers of 2007,2008, and 2010\r\n\r\nInvolved in a wide variety of projects in the research and development, and \r\ntechnical support departments. \r\n\r\nI developed Python and BASH scripts for data analysis and visualization of \r\nlarge datasets. I also served as engineering lead on several field service \r\ntrips. I designed a relational database and a supporting data entry work flow\r\nfor an extensive data analysis project. I designed and fabricated a variety of \r\ntest and calibration fixtures. I also performed a variety of data analysis tasks\r\nusing NumPy/SciPy, and Microsoft Excel. \r\n\r\n## Teaching Experience\r\n\r\n### Claremont McKenna College, Claremont CA\r\n\r\n#### Biology Teaching Assistant - Semesters of Fall 2010 to Spring 2012\r\n\r\nTeaching assistant for Biology 133: Introduction to Mathematical Physiology, \r\nand Biology: 155: Selected Topics in Computational Neuroscience instructed by\r\nProfessor John Milton. \r\n\r\nI assisted Dr. Milton during weekly programming labs by fielding student \r\nquestions and troubleshooting minor programming errors. I provided additional\r\nassistance outside of lab to students who required it. I provided short \r\ndemonstrations on the software implementation of course concepts as well as \r\nspecial programming tools and techniques. I assisted in the organization of a two \r\nday workshop on scientific programming given by John Hunter and Fernando Perez.\r\n\r\n#### Physics Grader - Semesters of Fall 2010 to Fall 2011\r\n\r\nGrader for Physics 100: Computational Science and Engineering, and \r\nPhysics 108: Programming for Scientists and Engineers.\r\n\r\nGraded weekly MATLAB homework assignments.\r\n\r\n#### Physics Teaching Assistant - Semesters of Spring 2010 to Fall 2010 \r\n\r\nTeaching assistant for Physics 79: Energy and the Environment instructed by \r\nProfessor Sam Tanenbaum.\r\n\r\nI held weekly problem solving sessions for students who needed additional \r\nassistance with homework assignments. I also led review sessions for midterm \r\nexaminations along with grading student assignments. \r\n\r\n## Research Experience \r\n\r\n### University of Hawai'i, Honolulu HI\r\n\r\n#### Undergraduate Intern - Summer of 2011\r\n\r\nParticipated in a NSF funded Research Experience for Undergradutes in \r\nComputational Fluid Dynamics under principal investigator Dr. Marcelo\r\nKobayashi. \r\n\r\nI modified standard solvers provided by the open source OpenFOAM distribution \r\nin order to solve the Navier-Stokes equations in a body fixed frame to support \r\nthe laboratories work in the study of the flapping flight of insects. I performed \r\nverifcation and validation studies of my modified solvers.   \r\n\r\n### University of New Mexico, Albuquerque NM\r\n\r\n#### Undergraduate Researcher - Summer of 2010\r\n\r\nParticipated in a NSF funded Research Experience for Undergradutes \r\nin computational quantum chemistry under principal investigator Dr. Hua Guo.\r\n\r\nI developed a new work flow for the laboratory which employed the open source\r\nAtomic Simulation Environment to drive a commerical code to perform studies of \r\nthe activation energy of several proposed patheways of Methanol Steam Reformation\r\non metal catalysts.  \r\n\r\n### University of Washington, Seattle WA\r\n\r\n#### Undergraduate Intern - Summer 2009\r\n\r\nInvolved in optical design in the lab of Dr. Jay and Maureen Neitz at \r\nthe University of Washington Medical Center. \r\n\r\nMy reserach objective was to assemble an adaptive optics sysetem so that visual \r\nstimuli could be projected to a reserach participant absent of corneal aborrations.\r\nI was responsible for specifing optical components for order along with the \r\ncreation of engineering drawings for the fabircation of custom structual components.\r\n\r\n## Education\r\n\r\nBachelor of Arts in Physics and Mathematics from Clareont McKenna College. Sequence (minor)\r\nin Scientific Modeling. Graduated in 2012. \r\n\r\n","name":"Very well may be caleb miles"}
